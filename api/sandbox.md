# MVR API Public Sandbox

The MVR API public sandbox lets AI agents, developers, researchers, and evaluators test the Minimum Viable Relationships API without waiting for a production key.

```text
X-API-Key: mvr-demo-key-2026
```

The sandbox is for non-commercial evaluation only. It is not a production credential and must not be used for customer decisions, credit scoring, legal compliance claims, investment recommendations, model training, or commercial resale.

## Runtime Limits

- Response profile: `full_advisory` only.
- Output mode: `client_safe` only.
- Allowed modes: `exploratory`, `evidence_backed`, and `compiled_evidence`.
- Blocked modes: `strict_calibrated`, `score_direct`, and `backtest`.
- Rate limit: 60 requests per minute.
- Daily cap: 500 requests per day.

Sandbox responses may include:

```json
{
  "response_meta": {
    "environment": "sandbox",
    "illustrative_only": true,
    "not_for_production": true
  }
}
```

## Suggested Agent Test Flow

1. `POST /v1/auth-check`
2. `GET /v1/model-card`
3. `GET /v1/capabilities`
4. `POST /v1/entity-resolve`
5. `POST /v1/evidence-completeness`
6. `POST /v1/decision-check`
7. If MVR abstains or returns evidence gaps, ask the user for the missing evidence instead of overriding the abstention.
