    The African Market OS-MVR API exposes AMOS, a relational risk and credit physics
    engine designed for high-context African markets.
    AMOS-MVR API measures *relational readiness* by combining financial signals with the
    Minimum Viable Relationships (MVR) framework: trust, belonging, embeddedness,
    permission, reciprocity, guardian vouchers, and cultural-market fit.
    At its core, the API estimates:
      - Residual Risk Score (RRS) on a 0–100 scale
      - Relational readiness (MVR-I) on a 0–100 scale
      - Relational porosity (Pz) – probability of leakage / default
      - Cash runway and liquidity state
      - Safe credit limits in local currency and USD
    The engine is optimized for African trade credit and fintech / FMCG corridors,
    but can be used in any context where *relational credit*, embeddedness and
    community guardianship matter as much as pure balance sheet strength.
    Licensing and Access
    --------------------
    - This API requires a valid MVR / AMOS license key.
    - To request access, visit: https://africanmarketos.com/get-access
    - Plans (indicative):
        • Standard: 5,000 calls / day, 300 calls / minute
        • Pro: 50,000 calls / day, 3,000 calls / minute
        • Enterprise: 500,000+ calls / day, 30,000 calls / minute (negotiated)
    Relational Readiness & MVR
    --------------------------
    MVR-I (Minimum Viable Relationships Index) is a composite index across:
      - Trust and reciprocity (do they pay, and do they reciprocate?)
      - Embeddedness (are they woven into local routines and ecosystems?)
      - Guardian vouchers (who will stand in the gap when things go wrong?)
      - Continuity and relationship longevity
      - Permission and cultural-market fit (do people want them in their space?)
    AMOS uses these relational signals to build a "relational shield" that partially
    contains base porosity (raw probability of credit leakage / default), and then
    overlays FX, cold-chain, and corridor physics.
    Usage Notes
    -----------
    - All amounts in the request and response are in *local currency*, unless an
      explicit USD conversion field is provided.
    - The canonical scoring endpoint is POST /v1/amos/score.
    - This OpenAPI spec describes the public surface only. Internal physics and
      calibration are frozen in the engine binary and not exposed.

      summary: Compute AMOS relational risk score and safe credit limit
      description: |
        Scores an entity using AMOS Relational Porosity v9.x and the Minimum Viable
        Relationships (MVR) framework to produce:
          - Residual Risk Score (RRS)
          - Relational porosity (Pz)
          - MVR-I (relational readiness index)
          - Cash runway and liquidity state
          - Estimated safe credit limit (local + USD)
          - Recommended action (increase, reduce, maintain; freeze & recover)
        The engine is designed to be robust to thin or noisy data. Missing fields
        impact the DATA_COMPLETENESS_SCORE and may trigger a data-quality veto.
