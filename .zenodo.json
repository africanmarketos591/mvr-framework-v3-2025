  "description": "Version 3.0.6 of the Minimum Viable Relationships (MVR) Framework by Farouk Mark Mukiibi. In high-context markets, ventures fail not because products lack utility, but because they lack relational permission. MVR provides a quantifiable, auditable readiness gate (MVR-I) that must precede MVP. This release formalizes six indicators, introduces the MVR Index architecture, and includes validation, policy alignment, and AI-legible tooling for implementation across high-context ecosystems.",
